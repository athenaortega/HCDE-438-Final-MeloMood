# Frame Your Thoughts: Overview & Purpose

This is a art-based journaling application that allows users to journal by reflecting on randomly selected pieces of artwork. Users are prompted with a question before reflecting on the selected artwork. 
The main components of the application are as follows:
- Creating a New Entry
- Viewing Past Entries
- Creating a Profile

-> The user is also able to log in and authenticate by using an email and password of their choice. The email/password authentication works and is implemented through Firebase.

-> Technologies used include React, Firebase, and VSCode. The languages used include CSS, HTML, JS. 

-> Setup & Installation: I deployed the web application through Firebase. The user inputted data is stored via Firebase. 

-> API Documentation: https://metmuseum.github.io/

-> Future enhancements or known issues: Sometimes the images for the randomly selected artworks are not properly displayed, so the user has to reload the page. For future iterations, I would ensure that any randomly selected image is always displayed.




# Takeaways
1. **Takeaway #1**
    1. Challenge: Setting up the scaffolding of the project was a bit challenging, but doing it from scratch really helped me with learning
    2. Solution: Understanding the scaffolding of the files in the debugging scavenger hunt helped me. That in-class activity was also valuable in helping me understanding how everything comes together.
2. **Takeaway #2**
    1. Challenge: For a long time, I was encountering a blank page when running the [localhost](http://localhost) page. 
    2. Solution: I didn't realize that all I had to do was save the file. That could have saved me about an hour of debugging. 
3. **Takeaway #3:** 
    1. Challenge: There were instances where only some pages of the web application would display, but other parts didn't work.
    2. Solution: Debugging in the console helped me so much! I was able to better understand why some parts were working and why some parts didn't.
4. **Takeaway #4:**
    1. Challenge: Understanding React components was a bit confusing at first, since this is my first time implementing React.
    2. Solution: Learning by doing was the best way to go. I learn best by just trying things out myself and also reading online articles too.
